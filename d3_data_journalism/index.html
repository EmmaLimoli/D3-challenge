          <h2>The Relationship Between Poverty and Healthcare</h2>
          <p>In this scatterplot, we analyze the relationship between poverty and healthcare.
            We look at six different factors to analyze if there's a relationship. We looked at: poverty, healthcare,
            age, income, obesity, and smoking. The data was taken from a CSV and we created a scatterplot where you're able to 
            look at each state's health and poverty data.
          </p>

          <p>What we can gather from the relationship between healthcare and poverty are a few things. One those is those who are lower income
            tend to smoke more than those who make over $70,000 a year. Many of those who smoke and are obese fall into the range of 30-45 years
            of age. When it comes to the amount of income in each state vs. the average percentage of healthcare many fall into less than 20% and an income 
            between $40,000 - $60,000. 
          </p>

          <p>We can also tell that states such as Texas have a very high percentage of poverty and an average of healthcare, however, they have more people in the state
            than say South Dakota. South Dakota on the other hand has an average of 14% of poverty and 10% of healthcare. What is interesting is states such as Massachussetts
            have very low poverty and very low healthcare. Obesity and income also go hand-in-hand. States that have higher average of obesity tend to make less money.
