          <h2>The Relationship Between Poverty and Healthcare</h2>
          <p>In this scatterplot, we analyzed the relationship between poverty and healthcare.
            We looked at six different factors to see if there's a relationship. We analyzed: poverty, healthcare,
            age, income, obesity, and smoking for each of the 50 states in the US. The data was taken from a CSV and we created a scatterplot where you're able to 
            look at each state's health and poverty data.
          </p>

          <p>What we can gather from the relationship between healthcare and poverty are a few things. One, those who are lower income
            tend to smoke more than those who make over $70,000 a year. Many of those who smoke and are obese fall into the range of 30-45 years
            of age. Additionally, the average income for states that have a low percentage of healthcare tend to range between $40,000 - $60,000.
          </p>

          <p>For individual states such as Texas, you'll notice there is a very high percentage of poverty and an average percentage of healthcare. However, they have a higher population 
             in the state compared to South Dakota. South Dakota, on the other hand, has an average of 14% of poverty and 10% of healthcare. What is interesting are states such as Massachusetts, which
            have very low poverty and very low healthcare. Obesity and income also go hand-in-hand. States that have higher average of obesity tend to make less money. 
          <br></br>
            What we can assume from this data is that there is a relationship between poverty levels and healthcare in each state. A state that is richer such as 
            Massachusetts has a low percentage of poverty, obesity, etc. Whereas a poorer state such as West Virgina has a low average income (about $40,000-50,000)
            and high obesity. This shows one side of the relationship between healthcare and poverty.
